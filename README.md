# AI-ON-CHIP-FOR-MACHINE-LEARNING-AND-INFERENCE

The project encompasses three programs, with two of them specifically devoted to the implementation of distinct functions, namely "Floating-point-MAC-verilog" and "PE array_for_model_accelerator." The third program, denoted as "Lenet_accelerator," is tasked with the implementation of the Lenet accelerator.

  - Floating-point-MAC-verilog:
    
    This program is designed to implement a floating-point Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operation using Verilog. The detailed explanation includes the algorithm, design considerations, and any relevant information to facilitate a comprehensive understanding.

  - PE array_for_model_accelerator:
    
    The second program, titled "PE array_for_model_accelerator," focuses on the implementation of a Processing Element (PE) array for a model accelerator. The detailed explanation covers the architecture, functionality, and how it contributes to the overall model acceleration process.

- Lenet_accelerator:
  
    The third program, "Lenet_accelerator," is responsible for the complete implementation of the Lenet accelerator. The detailed explanation encompasses the integration of the aforementioned programs, the overall structure of the Lenet accelerator, and any critical components or optimizations incorporated into the design.
